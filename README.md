# Widget Maker 2.0 Alpha

Hey, thanks for wanting to check out the widget-maker alpha.

Keep in mind that it is in a very early phase of development and there are plenty of features missing and potentially a few bugs - you won't be able to actually work with this software just yet.

**My goal with this alpha is:**

- Validation, does this make sense? Who are the people who'd want to use this?

- Direction, what is the most exciting feature? Understanding in which direction this project should go.

The widget maker is currently available as a Web and Windows App.

The web version can be found under [https://www.widgetmaker.dev](https://www.widgetmaker.dev/) - the password is widgetMaker2019. I'd kindly ask you not to share the link around just yet as there is quite a bit to be done before the public can use it.

The windows download can be found under [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jpcFXp222bGLU0YeFRAw6s_TGnnT6Dve/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jpcFXp222bGLU0YeFRAw6s_TGnnT6Dve/view?usp=sharing) (next version will be hostes as a release here in the repository)

If there are any problems with it, feel free to report them to me and use the web version instead!

I got this little 2-minute survey which would be awesome if you could fill out after playing around with the app.

Again, please keep in mind that this is at a very early stage and there are a lot of missing features!

## **Known crucial missing features:**

- There is no way to copy the code as both flutter_web and flutter_desktop don’t support the clipboard yet. This will hopefully soon change
- Web doesn’t support the keyboard other than textfields. That means keys like the arrow keys and the delete key don’t work.
- Changing colors can only be done using the rgb values. This will be implemented shortly
- Icons are not yet changeable

*Depending on the feedback I get, you can expect a lot to change over the next weeks!*
